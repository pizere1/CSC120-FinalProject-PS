Reflection: 
We had an amazing time making this game. We were very excited when we brainstormed the idea of potential "Prison Break" for our
game. 

Our Overall Approach was to divide the work on the basis of claases between us and meet at a fixed interval to merge and discuss the changes, provide feedback to each other. We overestimated out potential intially; however, as we delved deeper we understood how to utilize out approach better and figured it out together.  The main thing I learned is collaboration in Programming and how it can be both difficult to integrate two people's thought for the same thing abut as well as working together makes it far more efficient. We like our game a lot. The only thing we would change is make the security guard more active, which we couldn't achieve due to time constraints. We would also have reduced the scale of our project intially. If we will we be given unlimited time, we would actually implement this design with our intial design of an island and people and objects that the player could interact with and make the map more clear. The most helpful advice was given to us by multiple users whom we asked to play our game. They fed unexpected commands that only had a few words right, so we opted to use contains instead of "equals" to take user command. To our past selfs, we would suggest to divide to plan the time for classes and leave extra time for debugging and confront the issues that we might have and also lessen our expectations. 

Both Peace and Swikriti had an amaxing time working with each other, we worked back and forth for our divided tasks as well and provided all the support (moral and technical), and would love to work together in the future.
