Reflection: 
We had an amazing time making this game. We were very excited when we brainstormed the idea of potential "Prison Break" for our
game. 

Our Intial Design: 
A Prison in an isolated Island. The prison's building is at the centre of the island. The player starts from his cell, finds his
way out of the cell, and the prison by finging clues and unlocking the tunnel. He needs to escape the security guards who are scattered throughout the island, interact with surrounding things like trees, animals, etc. and find a boat. Unlock the boat and then sail away to win. 
Possible Classes: 
Room- Prisoner cell, Some other prisoners' cell, etc,
Building- Prison
Island Map
People- Player, Cellmate, Security Guards
Ship/Boat 
Trees
Other animal/birds
NEW THING we were plannning to add: Timer of around 3minutes at some point to pressurize the player into escaping which may or maynot have to run depending on the player


Our Final Design: 
A prison with 2 floors (first floor and a basement).  The prison starts from his cell, but needs to figure out some clues and pick righ items to unlock his door to go out. (Change). He gets a potential clue from his cellmate if he moves in that direction. If not, he can move throughout the building. A few places like The jailer room and AR interact with the player. He has to find his way to the escape room (very obvious), where he will need to go through some items lying around the room and work with some clues to find an item that lets him to the underground tunnel and eventually win. 
Changes: Everything outside of the building were eliminated due to time constriction and some extra elements and interactions were added within the building to keep the game interesting.
